# WWE React

<!-- TODO: What do you think about React so far? What make sense? What connections are there to the JS fundamentals that you have learned prior to this? Reflect and personalize this! -->

# Code Along Reflections

This code-along focused on React. We took time to create a components directory within the project. Within that directory, we added props. Props serve as a vital mechanism for passing data from parent to child components in React. They ensure a unidirectional flow of data, promoting a modular and reusable component architecture. By treating props as read-only and immutable, React enforces functional programming. When rendering, the belts and champions data demonstrate the practical application of components and props in React by dynamically generating UI elements based on data passed through props.
